summary(finaldata)

# 20 missing obs for popdens, urban, male_edu, temp, rainfall1000, infant_mortality
# neonatal_mortality, under5_mortatlity

# 426 missing obs for maternal_mortality and 62 missing obs for gdp1000

# So, we have data that is MNAR 

missing_data <- finaldata[!complete.cases(finaldata), ]


# View countries with the 20 missing obs

missing_countries <- finaldata[is.na(finaldata$rainfall) |

# View the countries with missing data
missing_countries$country_name



# All 20 missings obs for popdens, urban, male_edu, temp and rainfall1000 are from
# Cote d'Ivoire.

# All 20 missing obs for infant, neonatal and under5 mortality are from Puerto Rico

# No obvious pattern for the missing obs for maternal mortality

# All obs for gdp1000 are missing for South Sudan, North Korea, Eritrea, Venezuela. For Somalia, Afghanistan and Sao Tome and Principe gdp values were missing except for the years 2018 and 2019 so this is MNAR. 


### EXPLORE DISTRIBUTION AND PROPERTIES OF VARIABLES #####


# Histogram for GDP
hist(finaldata$gdp1000, main = "Distribution of GDP", xlab = "GDP (in thousands)", col = "lightblue")

## Most values for GDP1000 fall between 0-10 (GDP in thousands) ##


# Density plot for Population Density
plot(density(finaldata$popdens, na.rm = TRUE), main = "Density Plot for Population Density", xlab = "Population Density", col = "red")

## Popdens values between 5 and 45 per 100,000 are more likely to occur or occur more frequently than other values ##


# Create a contingency table of OECD membership by country
table(finaldata$country_name, finaldata$OECD)

# Only Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Chile changed OECD membership status through the observation period in this dataset #

# Filter the data for Latvia, Lithuania, and Chile
subset_country <- subset(finaldata, country_name %in% c("Latvia", "Lithuania", "Chile"))

table(subset_country$country_name, subset_country$OECD, subset_country$Year)

#Chile became an OECD country in 2011, Latvia in 2017 and Lithuania in 2019.


### DENSITY PLOTS FOR CATEGORICAL VARIABLES ###

# Plot for region by year

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(finaldata, aes(x = as.factor(Year), fill = region)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Region Distribution by Year", 
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Frequency", 
       fill = "Region") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

## Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin American & the Caribbean were the regions that had the highest frequency reported in every year ##

### CORRELATION MATRIX FOR CONTINUOUS VARIABLES ###

# Compute correlation matrix
continuous_vars <- finaldata[, c("gdp1000", "popdens", "agedep", "male_edu", "temp", "rainfall1000", "totdeath", "Maternal_Mortality", "Infant_Mortality", "Neonatal_Mortality", "Under5_Mortality")]
cor_matrix <- cor(continuous_vars, use = "complete.obs")

# Visualize the correlation matrix
library(corrplot)
corrplot(cor_matrix, method = "color", type = "upper", tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45)


## All the mortality variables are correlated with each other, suggesting that countries with higher maternal mortality also seem to have higher infant, neonatal and under-5 mortality rates. There is also a moderate positive correlation between the age dependency ratio and mortality rates.

## GDP seems to be negatively correlated with maternal, infant and neonatal mortality, suggesting that countries with higher GDP tend to have lower mortality rates. Interestingly, male education is also negatively correlated with the mortality variables, suggesting that higher levels of male education are associated with lower mortality rates.


### SUMMARIZE DATA BY GROUP ###
# Summarize data by region #

library(dplyr)
finaldata %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(mean_gdp = mean(gdp1000, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_popdens = mean(popdens, na.rm = TRUE))


### CHECK OUTLIERS ###

# Boxplot for GDP

library(ggplot2)

ggplot (finaldata, aes(y = gdp1000)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "orange") + 
  labs(title = "Boxplot of GDP", y = "GDP (in thousands)") + 
  theme_minimal()

 # the 62  missing values for gdp1000 were removed from this plot



# Plot and look at infant mortality by armed conflict status #

finaldata |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Infant_Mortality, group = region)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = as.factor(armconf1)), alpha = 0.5) +
  xlim(c(2000,2019)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans='log10') + 
  labs(y = "Infant mortality", x = "Year", color = "Armed conflict") + 
  theme_bw()

# Plot and look at maternal mortality by armed conflict status #

finaldata |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Maternal_Mortality, group = region)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = as.factor(armconf1)), alpha = 0.5) +
  xlim(c(2000,2019)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans='log10') + 
  labs(y = "Maternal Mortality", x = "Year", color = "Armed conflict") + 
  theme_bw()

# Plot and look at neonetal mortality by armed conflict status #

finaldata |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Neonatal_Mortality, group = region)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = as.factor(armconf1)), alpha = 0.5) +
  xlim(c(2000,2019)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans='log10') + 
  labs(y = "Neonatal mortality", x = "Year", color = "Armed conflict") + 
  theme_bw()
 

# Plot and look at under 5 mortality by armed conflict status #

finaldata |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Under5_Mortality, group = region)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = as.factor(armconf1)), alpha = 0.5) +
  xlim(c(2000,2019)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans='log10') + 
  labs(y = "Under 5 mortality", x = "Year", color = "Armed conflict") + 
  theme_bw()
